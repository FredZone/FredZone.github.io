<X5>MY GADGETS...</X5>
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>MUSIC GEAR:
<br>I sing into a <X3>Shure SM58</X3> microphone
<br>and play a <X3>Fender Stratocaster</X3> guitar
<br>through a <X3>Digitec RP55</X3> effects pedal.
<br>All amplified by a <X3>Fender Passport 300 PRO</X3>
<br>with a <X3>Fender</X3> 10 watt amp for a stage monitor.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>BACKING TRACKS:
<br>I play guitar and sing over Backing Tracks.  
<br>created with <X3>BAND IN A BOX</X3> software
<br>Typically, I use synthetic Drums & Bass .
<br>I often add a Piano, Harmonica
or another Guitar...
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>VOCAL HARMONY
<br>I use a <X3>TC Helicon Voice Live 1</X3>
<br>Its an old electronic device
<br>that synthesizes up to 4 voices
<br>guided by my voice and the Key of the Song.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>COMPUTING:
<br>I wrote a  program in <X3>'javascript'</X3>
<br>to play my back tracks and
<br>sychronize them with
<br>scrolling lyrics and chord notation.
<br>I use a generic <X3>Android tablet</X3>
<br>to run that program.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>RECORDING:
<br>On the rare recording I use
<br>a <X3>Tascam DR-05</X3> digital recorder
<br>plugged into the PA output jack
<br><X3>Audacity</X3> freeware is used to convert
<br>the tracks to mono MP3s for the Web.
