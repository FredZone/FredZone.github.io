<X5>MY GADGETS...</X5>
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>MUSIC GEAR:
<br>a <X3>Shure SM58</X3> Microphone for vocals.
<br>I play a <X3>Fender Stratocaster</X3> guitar
<br>through a <X3>Digitec RP55</X3> effects pedal
<br>My Sound System is a <X3>Fender Passport 300 PRO</X3>.
<br>My stage monitor is a <X3>Fender</X3> 10 watt amp.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>BACKING TRACKS:
<br>I use <X3>Band in a Box</X3> Software
<br>to create Backing Tracks.
<br>Typically, I use Drums, Bass & Guitar.
<br>Occasionally, I add a Piano, Harmonica, Horn, or Strings.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>VOCAL HARMONY
<br>I use a <X3>TC Helicon Voice Live 1</X3>
<br>Its an old electronic device
<br>that synthesizes up to 4 voices.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>COMPUTING:
<br>I wrote a program in <X3>'javascript'</X3>
<br>to play my tracks and sychronize them with
<br>scrolling lyrics and chord notation.
<br>Normally I use a generic <X3>Android tablet</X3>
<br>to run that program.
<br><X2>====================</X2>
<br>RECORDING:
<br>On the rare occasion I record anything
<br>I use a <X3>Tascam DR-05</X3> digital recorder
<br>plugged into the PA's output jack
<br><X3>Audacity</X3> freeware is used to
<br>post process the tracks.
