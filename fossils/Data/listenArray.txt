Abeline was written by Bob Gibson,
<br>Albert Stanton,Lester Brown and

<br>Gibson was inspired to write the song
<br>after watching the Randolph Scott film
<br>'Abilene Town.'
<br>The town was Abilene, Kansas,

|The Cape is by Guy Clark
<br>One of my favorite songs. Written 
<br>by Guy Clark, Susanna Clark, Jim Janosky

<br>without a backing track...
<br>Thats really all it needs.
