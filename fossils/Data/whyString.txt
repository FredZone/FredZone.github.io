    <X5>WHY AN ELECTRONIC BAND?</X5><br>
    I'd would rather play with others and,
    <br>occasionally bring friends along
    <br><X5>HOWEVER!...</X5>
    <br>
    Organizing, scheduling and rehearsing a
    <br>group of retirees is like hearding cats.
    <br>
    <X1>SO ITS USUALLY JUST ME...</X1>
    <br> and my VIRTUAL BAND!
