Total Bone Heads

A vast wasteland was the way
Television was once described.
Where mindless folks on sofas
in shallow tales imbibed.
But then the internet came along
with the promise of better days.
Where well produced educational fare
would be the order of the day.
But the internet and truth
were not a perfect fit.
Sit back and let me show you
some of cyberspace's shit.
