#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
'Till the universe explodes as a falling star is raised
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
But they all glow brighter from the brilliance of the blaze
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
With the speed of insanity, then he dies.
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
In the green fields a turnin', a baby is born
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
His cries crease the wind and mingle with the morn
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
An assault upon the order, the changing of the guard
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Chosen for a challenge that is hopelessly hard
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
And the only single sound is the sighing of the stars
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
But to the silence of distance they are sworn
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|Em              |C           |D             |Em
So  dance  dance dance        Teach us to be true
|C               |D           |D             |Em
Come dance dance dance        Cause we love you
#VERSE 3 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
Images of innocence charge him go on
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
And a blinding revelation is laid upon his plate
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
That beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
And God help the critic of the dawn.
#VERSE 4 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
So he stands on the sea and shouts to the shore,
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
And the merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
'Till the giant is aware, someone's pulling at his leg,
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
And someone is tapping at the door.
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
|Em              |C           |D             |Em
So  dance  dance dance        Teach us to be true
|C               |D           |D             |Em
Come dance dance dance        Cause we love you
#VERSE 5 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads across the land
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
The rewarding of his pain is the following of the man
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
But ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
For blood is the language of the band.
#VERSE 6 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Excitement is ecstatic, passion places bets
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Gracefully he bows to ovations that he gets
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
But the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
And saliva is falling from their smiles
#CHORUS 3 -------------------------------
|Em              |C           |D             |Em
So  dance  dance dance        Teach us to be true
|C               |D           |D             |Em
Come dance dance dance        Cause we love you
#VERSE 7 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
Then this overflow of life is crushed into a liar
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
First a smile of rejection at the nearness of the night
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
All the heavens are horrified they stagger from the sight
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
As the cross is trembling with desire.
#VERSE 8 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
They say they can't believe it, it's a sacrilegious shame
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game 
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
How did it happen   I hope his suffering was small.
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Tell me every detail, for I've got to know it all,
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
And do you have a picture of the pain 
#CHORUS 4 -------------------------------
|Em              |C           |D             |Em
So  dance  dance dance        Teach us to be true
|C               |D           |D             |Em
Come dance dance dance        Cause we love you
#VERSE 9 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
Time takes her toll and the memory fades
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
but his glory is broken, in the magic that he made.
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Reality is ruined; it's the freeing from the fear
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
The drama is distorted, to what they want to hear
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
As they wait for a new thrill parade.
#VERSE 10 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
The eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
To the safety of sterility, the threat has been refined
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
The child was created to the slaughterhouse he's led
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
And the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.
#CHORUS 5 -------------------------------
|Em              |C           |D             |Em
So  dance  dance dance        Teach us to be true
|C               |D           |D             |Em
Come dance dance dance        Cause we love you
#VERSE 11 --------------------------------
|Em           |%               |%            |D
And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
|G            |%               |%            |Bm
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
'Till the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
|Am           |D               |G            |Em
But they all glow brighter from the briliance of the blaze
|Am           |D               |Em           |%
With the speed of insanity, then he died.
