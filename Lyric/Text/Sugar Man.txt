#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
There are shadows on the sidewalks
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm
Of the city streets at night
|Dm                |Am
And the alleyways and ugly things
|F#m7b5            |E7
Are hidden from the light
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
And somewhere soon, my baby's
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm    ~A7    ~Dm   ~
Gonna sell her soul again
|Dm       ~G       |Am     ~F#m7b5
For a custom tailored lady killer
|F7       ~E7       |Am
They call Sugar Man
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
I searched the backstreet barrooms
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm
And every cheap hotel
|Dm                |Am
Asking for my baby
|F#m7b5            |E7
They all knew her well
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
Well, they said, she's out there working
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm    ~A7    ~Dm   ~
For the wages of her sin
|Dm       ~G       |Am     ~F#m7b5
And if you want to find your baby, Baby
|F7       ~E7       |Am
Look for Sugar Man
#VERSE 3 --------------------------------
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
Well  tonight I found her
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm
On the sorry side of town
|Dm                |Am
Lying cold upon the bed
|F#m7b5            |E7
Where she had laid her body down
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
I     picked up the needle
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm    ~A7    ~Dm   ~
that had fallen from her hand
|Dm       ~G       |Am     ~F#m7b5
And stuck it through the money
|F7       ~E7       |Am
she had made for Sugar Man
#VERSE 4 --------------------------------
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
There are shadows on the sidewalks
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm
Of the city streets at night
|Dm                |Am
And the alleyways and ugly things
|F#m7b5            |E7
Are hidden from the light
|Am       ~E7       |Am       ~A7
But the sun's gonna shine tomorrow
|Dm       ~A7       |Dm    ~A7    ~Dm   ~
On some dirty gargage cans
|Dm       ~G       |Am     ~F#m7b5
And a custom tailored lady killer
|F7       ~E7       |Am
They called Sugar Man
