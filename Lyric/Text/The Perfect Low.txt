|                     |                     |                     |
There once was a man /named 'Tell it to me Dan'/ He was nothing like me or you.
|                     |                     |                     |
Cause laying back/ and absorbing crap/ was all he cared to do.
|                     |                     |                     |
As a kid, he sat in the cellar/ reading John Britch magazines.
|                     |                     |                     |
Because he knew Westbrook Pegler/ wouldn't lie to you and me
|                     |                     |                     |
And when he read a the "Fountain Head" he thought he found the truth
|                     |                     |                     |
And he proceeded down the rabbit hole where he would spend his tender youth
|                     |                     |                     |
He tried Ron Hubbard's Dianetics, but the e-meter wouldn't move
|                     |                     |                     |
And Von Daniken's chariots were cool/ but he couldn't find the groove
|                     |                     |                     |
Velecovskis colliding worlds were neat/ but the timeline didn't fit
|                     |                     |                     |
He looked into pyramidology/ but even he knew that was shit.
|                     |                     |                     |
But all internet surfing left something in the back of his mind
|                     |                     |                     |
The world was be run by an evil force/and it was something that he could find


|                     |                     |                     |
Then he heard of a cat named Baba Fats/ who could expose an evil cabal.
|                     |                     |                     |
But Fats was now an internet cat/ hidden behind a fire wall.
|                     |                     |                     |
"But hell," says Dan/"I’m stubborn man/ and I’ll climb or fly or crawl
|                     |                     |                     |
And I’ll find that guru who’ll give me a clue/ to the truth about it all."
|                     |                     |                     |
So he sits down at his computer / following links /one at a time,
|                     |                     |                     |
Down paths no man could follow/ through twists without reason or rhyme
|                     |                     |                     |
For thirteen years he tried site after site/ then back to reality he'd fall...
|                     |                     |                     |
He'd sit –– and cry –– and try again/ pursuing the link that would tell it all.
|                     |                     |                     |
He ground down teeth/ his eyes turned blood red/ He was aching and shaking and weak,
|                     |                     |                     |
He sat on his ass till his legs atrophied /his blood pressure was at its peak
|                     |                     |                     |
Then his eyes popped wide like a stalking cat, and he snarled and grinned like a rat,
|                     |                     |                     |
For there on his screen/ on a background of green –– sat the godlike Baba Fats.

|                     |                     |                     |
"What’s happening, Fats?" says Dan to the Man, "I’ve come to state my biz.
|                     |                     |                     |
I hear you’re know/who runs the show./Please tell me who that is.
|                     |                     |                     |
For you can see,"/says Dan to he,/"that I’m about to lose it all,
|                     |                     |                     |
So for my last download, Fats, can I expose the great cabal?"
|                     |                     |                     |
"Well, dog my cats!" says Baba Fats. "Its another burnt–out soul,
|                     |                     |                     |
Who’s looking for some internet link to turn bullshit to gold.
|                     |                     |                     |
But you won’t find it in some shady link or on a dark-web hyper-shelf.
|                     |                     |                     |
Son, if you would seek the truth –– take science and reason into yourself"

|                     |                     |                     |
"Why, you jive motherfucker!" screamed Dan,/"I’ve web surfed the web for years
|                     |                     |                     |
My bloodshot eyes can hardly see, there's a ringing in my ears...
|                     |                     |                     |
I’ve worn out the fingers on my hands and I can hardly stand to piss!
|                     |                     |                     |
Then, you tell me the truth is in myself. What kind of shit is this?
|                     |                     |                     |
My ears ’fore headphones made them deaf," says Dan, "had heard all kind of crap,
|                     |                     |                     |
But I didn’t surf the net all that time/ just to hear that stale rap.
|                     |                     |                     |
And I dont want to hear/that the conspiracies/ are just the right wing passing gas
|                     |                     |                     |
I know where you live/so give up the cabal/or I’ll kill your guru ass!"

|                     |                     |                     |
"Ok, OK," says Baba Fats, "you’ve forced me to go on.
|                     |                     |                     |
There's a prophet on the internet who’s known as Q-Anon.
|                     |                     |                     |
From TV towers and satellites/ through pod casts, like X22
|                     |                     |                     |
From FOX and Newsmax's mindless drones/ wisdom comes to you
|                     |                     |                     |
And just when you think you've heard it all/they'll pull something out of their ass
|                     |                     |                     |
Like the world is run by George Soros/ or Joe Biden finished last
|                     |                     |                     |
And he who listens carefully/ will  know what's behind it all
|                     |                     |                     |
For the story moves you like a tidal wave/and it hits you in the balls.
|                     |                     |                     |
But the net also has two giants/ who stand twelve cubits high.
|                     |                     |                     |
With all seeing eyes in oversize heads/they wait for you to come by.
|                     |                     |                     |
They are Science and Reason/ and they'll beg you to give them a try.
|                     |                     |                     |
They'll layout proofs and peer review/ but you'd best pass them by
|                     |                     |                     |
"To hell with proof and logic"/laughed Dan./" I'll believe in what no-one can see
|                     |                     |                     |
And as long as Qanon  goes on/ there's still is hope for me!
|                     |                     |                     |
And with tears of joy in his bloodshot eyes/ Dan bid the guru goodbye,
|                     |                     |                     |
He logged out of the Baba's cloud/ and flew into the a rightwing sky.

|                     |                     |                     |
"Well, that is that," says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his throne,
|                     |                     |                     |
Facing another thousand years of texting God alone.
|                     |                     |                     |
"Lord"/ typed Fats/ "it’s always the same/ old men or bright–eyed youth,
|                     |                     |                     |
It’s always easier to sell them some shit /than it is to tell them the truth."
