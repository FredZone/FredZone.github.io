#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
It's a jungle out there
Violence and danger everywhere
It's brother against brother pounding on each other
Like they were millionaires
It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle in here, too
You gonna tap out on your phone
That microphone, that camera checking out everything you do
Call it paranoia, as the saying goes
Even paranoia's an enemy
I'm not the one who's crazy, I'm not afraid to live
They're afraid of you and me
I could be wrong now, but I don't think so
'Cause it's a jungle out there
Yeah, it's a jungle out there
#OUTRO ----------------------------------
It's a jungle out there
Even the cops are scared today
So if you see a uniform
Do exactly what they say
Or make a run for it
I'm only kidding with you!
'Cause it's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there!﻿
