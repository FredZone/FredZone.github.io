#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|E                  |B
It was painted red, the stripe was white
|A                  |%
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
|E                  |B
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
|A                  |%
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get 'er
|E                  |B
Put on a shine put on a motor
|A                  |A
Built out of love and made for the water
|E                  |B
Ran her for years 'till the transom got rotten
|A                  |A
A piece of my childhood that'll never be forgotten
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|E                  |B
It was just an old plywood boat
|A                  |%
With a seventy-five Johnson with electric choke
|E                  |B
A young boy two hands on the wheel
|A                  |%
I can't replace the way it made me feel
|E                  |B
And I would turn her sharp and I'd make it wide
|A                  |%
And he'd say you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
|E                  |F#
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
|A                  |B
But I was king of the ocean when daddy let me
|E                  |%
drive
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|E                  |B
Just a short bed half ton ford
|A                  |%
My Uncle bought new in 64
|E                  |B
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smokin'
|A                  |%
A couple a burnt valves and he had it going
|E                  |B
He'd let me drive when he took load
|A                  |A
of trash to dump on Thigpen Road
|E                  |B
Id sit up on the seat ans stretch my feet out to the pedals
|A                  |A
Smiling like a hero who just received his medals
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
|E                  |B
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
|A                  |%
With a three speed on the column and a dent in the door
|E                  |B
A young boy two hands on the wheel
|A                  |%
I can't replace the way it made me feel
|E                  |B
I would press that clutch and I'd keep it right
|A                  |A
And he'd say a little slower son you're doin' just fine
|E                  |F#
Just a dirt road with trash on each side but I was
|A                  |B

|E                  |B
Im all grown up now, 3 girls of my own
|A                  |%
I let em drive the Jeep cross the pasture at our home
|E                  |B
maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
|A                  |%
Pull out that old memory and think of me and smile And say

#CHORUS 3 -------------------------------
|E                  |B
It was just an old worn out jeep
|A                  |%
Rusty old floor boards hot on my feet
|E                  |B
A young girl two hands on the wheel
|A                  |%
I can't replace the way it made me feel
|E                  |B
And he'd say turn it left and steer it right
|A                  |A
Straighten up girl now you're doin' just fine
|E                  |B
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
|A                  |B
But I was high on a mountain when daddy let me --
