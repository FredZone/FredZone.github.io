#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
This old highway's getting longer
|G               |F               |C               |G
Seems there ain't no end in sight
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
To sleep would be best But I just can't afford to rest
|G               |F               |C               |G
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
I called the house, but no one answered
|G               |F               |C               |G
For the last two weeks no one's been home
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
I guess she's through with me To tell the truth, I just can't see
|G               |F               |C               |G
What's kept a woman holding on this long
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
@Harmony on chorus from here out
|F               |%               |C      ~Em      |Am
And the white line's getting longer And the saddle's getting cold
|F               |G               |C               |C7
Now I'm much too young to feel this damn old
|F               |%               |C      ~Em      |Am
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
|F               |G               |C               |C
Now I'm much too young to feel this damn old
#VERSE 3 --------------------------------
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
The competition's getting younger
|G               |F               |C               |G
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
|C               |%               |Dm              |%
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, Lonely women and bad booze
|G               |F               |C               |G
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all.
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
|F               |%               |C      ~Em      |Am

|F               |G               |C               |C7
Now I'm much too young to feel this damn old
|F               |%               |C      ~Em      |Am
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
|F               |G               |C               |C

@@This was Brooks' first hit.
@@One line mentions a "Worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux." Chris LeDoux was a country singer who had been performing for years but had never achieved a large following. However, he was a big influence on Brooks.
@@When this song became a hit, it resurrected LeDoux's career. Brooks and LeDoux later collaborated on "What'cha Gonna Do With a Cowboy?"
@@LeDoux passed away in 2005 at age 56.
