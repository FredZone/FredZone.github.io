#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
    |C      |G7      |B      |C
I'll   take you   home again,  Kathleen,
    |G7      |G      |G7      |C
Across the   ocean wild and wide,
    |G7      |BC
To where your       heart has eve      r been
    |G      |D7      |C      |D7      |G
Since       first you       were my       bon      ny       bride.
    |G7      |B      |C
The       roses all have left       your       cheek,
    |G7      |C
I've       watched them fade away and       die;
|E7      |Am      |Dm      |E      |A7
Your       voice is sad when       e'er you       spe      ak
    |D7      |C      |D7      |C      |D7      |G
|And       tears  be-      dim       your       lov      ing       eyes.
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
    |C      |G7      |B      |C
Oh,       I  will       take you  back,       Kath      leen,
    |G7      |G      |G7      |C
To       where your       heart       will feel no       pain;
    |C7      |F
And when the       fields are fresh and       green,
|C      |C      |G7      |C
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
I'll t      ake you       to your home       again.
I know you love me, Kathleen dear,
Your  heart was ever fond and true,
I always feel when you are near,
That life holds nothing, dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me,
I scarcely ever see them now;
Though many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
#CHORUS 3 -------------------------------
To that dear home beyond the sea,
My Kathleen shall again return,
And when thy old friends welcome thee,
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream,
Beside your mother's  humble cot,
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam,
There all your grief will be forgot.
