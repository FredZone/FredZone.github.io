Some of them  were  dreamers
|C                     |G
And some of them were fools      Who were
|Em                    |C                
 making  plans  and  thinking  of  the 
|G   ~     ~     ~C    |G
future
|G                     |%
With the energy of the innocent
|C                     |G
They were gathering the tools      They would 
|Em                    |C             
need to make  their journey back to
|G                     |%
nature                             While the     
|Em                    |G
sand slipped through the opening   And their 
|C                     |G
hands reached for the golden ring  With their 
|Em                    |C               
hearts they turned to each other's heart for 
|D                     |%
refuge
|Em                    |C             
In the troubled years that came before the 
|G   ~     ~     ~C    |G
deluge
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|G                     |%
Some of them knew pleasure
|C                     |G
And some of them knew pain
|Em                    |C                
And for some of them it was only the moment
|G   ~     ~     ~C    |G
that mattered
|G                     |%
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
|C                     |G
They went flying around in the rain
|Em                    |C             
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and
|G                     |%
tattered
|Em                    |G
And in the end they traded their tired wings
|C                     |G
For the resignation that living brings
|Em                    |C               
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
|D                     |%
For the glitter and the rouge
|Em                    |C             
And in the moment they were swept before
|G   ~     ~     ~C    |G
the deluge                Now let the music keep our

When the light that's lost within us reaches the

Some of them were angry
|C                     |G
At the way the earth was abused
|Em                    |C                
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into
|G   ~     ~     ~C    |G
Power
|G                     |%
And they struggled to protect her from them
|C                     |G
Only to be confused
|Em                    |C             
By the magnitude of her fury in the final
|G                     |%
hour
|Em                    |G
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
|C                     |G
In the naked dawn only a few survived
|Em                    |C               
And in attempts to understand a thing so 
|D                     |%
simple and so huge           Believed that 
|Em                    |C             
they were meant to live       after the
