#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|G                            |D           |G
There's an Elvis movie on the marquee sign
|C          |G            |D      |G
We've all seen at least three times
                  |D             |G
Everybody's broke Bobby's got a buck
               |C         |G          |D        |G
To put a dollar's worth of gas in his pickup truck
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|C
We're goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end road
|G                   |D                 |Em
What's the hurry son where're you gonna go
|C                      |G    |D                |G
We're gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
|C            |G  |D       |G
It's a small town Saturday night

#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|G                           |D        |G
Lucy's got her lipstick on a little too bright
|C              |G        |D            |G
Bobby's gettin' drunk and lookin' for a fight
                        |D                |G
Liquor on his breath and trouble on his mind
|C                |G    |D         |G
And Lucy's just a kid along for the ride
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
|C
Got a six-pack of beer and a bottle of wine
|G                   |D          |Em
Gotta be bad just to have a good time
|C            |G                |D              |G
They're gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
|C             |G  |D          |G
It's a small town Saturday night
|C            |G  |D           |G
It's a small town Saturday night

Bobby told Lucy the world ain't round
|C         |G           |D     |G
Drops off sharp at the edge of town
                  |D             |G
Lucy you know the world must be flat
|C                      |G       |D         |G
Cause when people leave town they never come back

|G                                     |D           |Em
Put the pedal to the metal â€˜fore their change their mind
|C               |G   |D              |G
They howl at the moon shoot out the light

It's a small town Saturday night
