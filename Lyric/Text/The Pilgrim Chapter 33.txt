#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
         |G            |G              |G             |G
See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
       |C             |C               |G       |G
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile--
|C             |C             |G            |Em
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
           |A7                |A7         |D (...sus4)   |D
Which he spent like they was goin' outa style--
        |G               |G               |G            |G
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
|C              |D              |G      |G
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found--
        |C          |C            |G           |G
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
           |C           |D               |G       |G
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
        |C           |C
He's a poet, he's a picker--
         |G             |G
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
        |D             |D              |D                |G
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
        |C            |C               |G              |G
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
       |D             |D             |D              |G      |G
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
       |A             |A            |A                |A
He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
           |D         |D         |A     |A
And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
|D               |D                |A           |F#m
Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars,
    |B7             |B7             |E     |E
And losin' all he's loved along the way--
            |A                   |A              |A             |A
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
          |D           |E          |A     |A
And all he ever gets is older and around--
         |D              |D           |A             |A
From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
     |D(or|Bm)    |E               |A      |A
The goin' up was worth the comin' down--
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
       |D           |D
He's a poet, he's a picker--
        |A             |A
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
       |E             |E              |E                |A
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
       |D            |D               |A              |A
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
      |E             |E             |E              |A       |A / g# f#
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
|E                           |E               |E             |A
     There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.
