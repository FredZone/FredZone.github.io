|G         |%          |Am       |%
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
|D7        |%         |G      |%
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
|G               |%        |Am        |%
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
|D7         |%        |G           |%
Music would play and Felina would whirl
#VERSE ----------------------------------
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
D7                              G
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
                          Am
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
D7                                G
I was in love but in vain I could tell
#CHORUS ---------------------------------
C           |           F           C
One night a wild young cowboy came in
            F          G7
Wild as the West Texas wind
 
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
                                   C
With wicked Felina the girl that I loved
      D7
So in anger I
#VERSE ----------------------------------
G                            Am
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
D7                                     G
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
                             Am
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
    D7                                      G
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
#VERSE ----------------------------------
                    Am
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
D7                                  G
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
                               Am
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
D7                                   G
I had but one chance and that was to run
#CHORUS ---------------------------------
C                            F        C
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
              F           G7
Out where the horses were tied
 A|
I caught a good one it looked like it could run
                              C
Up on its back and away I did ride
        D7
Just as fast as I
G                         Am
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
D7                              G
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico
#VERSE ----------------------------------
                   Am
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
D7                                   G
Everything's gone in life nothing is left
                             Am
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
D7                                  G
My love is stronger than my fear of death
#CHORUS ---------------------------------
  C              F          C
I saddled up and away I did go
        F           G7
Riding alone in the dark 
                             
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
                                             C
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
       D7
And at last here I
#VERSE ----------------------------------
G                  Am
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
D7                       G
I can see Rosa's cantina below
                         Am
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
D7                            G
Down off the hill to Felina I go
#VERSE ----------------------------------
                      Am
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
D7                             G
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
                        Am
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
D7                               G
I have to make it to Rosa's back door
#CHORUS ---------------------------------
C                       F           C
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
               F          G7
A deep burning pain in my side

Though I am trying to stay in the saddle 
                            C
I'm getting weary unable to ride
 
       D7
But my love for
#VERSE ----------------------------------
  G                    Am
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
D7                                G
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
                        Am
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
D7                              G
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
#VERSE ----------------------------------
                    Am
From out of nowhere Felina has found me
D7                                   G
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
                      Am
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
D7                         G
One little kiss and Felina good-bye
