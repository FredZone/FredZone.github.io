TITLE:Still Gonna Die,DUR:180,BPM:120,BEATS:4,KEY:G,QUAL:Raw,ARTIST:Shel Silverstein,GENRE:Country,STYLE:Up Tempo,HITyear:TBD

So you're takin' better care of your body 
Becoming more aware of your body. 
Responding to your body's needs. 
Everything you hear and read about diets, 
Nutrition and sleeping position and detoxifying your system, 
And buying machines that they advertise to help you exercise.
Herbs to revitalize you if you're traumatized.
Soaps that will sanitize.
Sprays to deordorize.
Liquid to neutralize acids and pesticides.
Free weights to maximize your strength and muscle size.
Shots that will immunize.
Pills to re-energize you.

But remember that for all your pain and gain
Eventually the story ends the same...
