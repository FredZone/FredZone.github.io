INTRO  CONSTANT CRAVING
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin

And constant (Constant)
Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always)
Been (Been)

Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls to what's true
Or maybe it is life itself
That feeds wisdom to its youth

Constant (Constant)
Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always)
Been (Been)

Craving
Ah, constant craving
Has always been
Has always been


Constant (Constant)
Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always)
Been (Been)

Constant (Constant)
Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always)
Been (Been)

Craving
Ah, constant craving
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
(Has always)
Always been
(Has always)
Always been
[fade out]
