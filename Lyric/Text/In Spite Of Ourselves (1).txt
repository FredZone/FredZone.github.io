#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|C
She don't like her eggs all runny
|C
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
|F
She looks down her nose at money
|C
She gets it on like the easter bunny
|G
She's my baby, I'm her honey
                       |C
I'm never gonna let her go
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|C
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
|C
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
|F
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
|C
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
|G
He's my baby, and I'm his honey
                   |C
Never gonna let him go
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|C          |F
In spite of ourselves
|F                           |C
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
           |G
Against all odds
                         |C
Honey, we're the big door prize
           |F
We're gonna spite our noses
                |C
Right off of our faces
              |G                  |G7
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
              |C
Dancin' in our eyes

She thinks all my jokes are corny

Convict movies make her horny
|F
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
|C
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs

She takes a lickin', and keeps on tickin'
                       |C
I'm never gonna let her go
#VERSE 4 --------------------------------
|C
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a wacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
|F
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
|C
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
|G
He's my baby, I don't mean maybe

Never gonna let him go

Our noses right off our faces,
