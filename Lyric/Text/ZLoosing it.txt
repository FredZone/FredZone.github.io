INTRO  LOOSING IT
I really dont remember the day I finally knew
That god was gone forever but life was just as good
That there really was no chosen race, no best loved precious few
That for control and comfort we had made up god

I still shared love with others though god was not in play
Light still shown upon the earth and shadows moved about
I still felt awe and wonder at the gift of each new day
But time was now a precious gift that day would run out

What changed was just perspective, not our actual worth
What we do creates the world my children will  
We still are unique animals on our tiny earth
