I.B. Farben manufactured children's toys.

Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.

--Was you not an SS guard? --I was not an SS guard.
I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
--Did you not love Ilsa Koch? --I did not love Ilsa Koch.
I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
--Did you not despise the Jews? --I did not; some of my best

friends...
I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
--Did you not think Adolf great? --I did not. Adolf who?
--Adolf who! --Ja, Adolf who?
--Fritz, you're putting me on. --Was bedeutet dieses 'putting

me on'?
--Are you kidding me or something? --Nein, I'm not kidding

you. Adolf who?
--Adolf Hitler. --Should I know him? Is he a folksinger?
--You don't remember. --Nein, I don't remember him. Who was

he?
--Well,...
|D              |G           |A7     |D
A little man, very mean, very loud and brash. --Mmm-mmm.
|D              |G           |A7     |D
Not too tall, he never smiled, wore a black mustache. --Nein;

I never heard...

He had a girl, Eva Braun, hair as red as flame. --Ah, ja, ja.
|D              |G           |A7     |D
He papered walls for many years till his moment came. --Of

course!

He's the one who clapped his hands, went into a dance.
When the news came to him that we had conquered France.

--That's him!
He once said, when our flag proudly was unfurled,
"Today, Germany, tomorrow, the world!" [Becomes a hysterical

chant] ...tomorrow, the world! ...tomorrow, the world!

...tomorrow, the world!
--I never heard of him. --Neither did I.

To our Israeli allies let us raise a toast.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
Sure there were some Nazis, two or three at most.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.

We tried to throw off Hitler right from the very start.
That's what ev'ry hist'ry book should tell.
We hated Heinrich Himmler, Martin Bormann, too.
We believe as Sherman did that war is

hell...hell...hell...hell...
[Again becomes a chant]...heil!...heil!...Sieg heil!...Sieg

heil!...Sieg heil!

Germans are as gentle as flowers in the spring.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
Germans are a people who love to dance and sing.
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.

--Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You there, you are not

singing. Did you not like to sing? Tell me, you still have a

family in Germany, nicht wahr? Sing!
|G           |A7   |D
Sing the I Was Not a Nazi Polka.
Sieg heil!
