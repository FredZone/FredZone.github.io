#verse 1
 |G                       |%
A couple guys in first class on a flight
|%                        |% 
From new York to Los Angeles,
|Bm                       |%
Kinda making small talk killing time,
 |%                             |C
Flirting with the flight attendants,
|%                          |%
30, 000 feet above, could be Oklahoma,
       |G                      |%
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms,
|%                    |Bm
Man it all looks the same,
|%                       |%
Miles and miles of back roads and highways,
|%                          |C
Connecting little towns with funny names,
               |%                          |D
Who'd want to live down there in the middle

of nowhere,
#CHORUS 1
              |Em                  |C
They've never drove through Indiana,
|%               |G
Met the men who plowed that earth,
 |%                 |D
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me,
             |Em               |C
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas,
                  |D                      |C
They'd understand why god made those fly over states

 I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
 |%                                                         |Bm
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
|C                         |%
Road and rails under their feet
|D
 Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
#CHORUS 2
       |Em             |C
On the plains of Oklahoma
              |G                     |%
Where the windshield sunset in your eyes
       |D                 |%
Like a watercolor painted sky
            |Em                 C
You'd think heavens doors have opened
       |%         |D
You'll understand why god made
          |C
Those fly over states

#Chorus 2
       |Em               |C
Take a ride across the badlands
|G
Feel that freedom on your face
|D
Breathe in all that open space
       |Em             |C
Meet a girl from Amarillo
|%                 |D
You'll understand why god made
 |%                |C
Why you'd want to plant your stakes
|%            |G
In those fly over states
