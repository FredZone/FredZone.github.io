@@From Mark Knopfler -I was learning about stews, like you do. One of the things I learned was that pigweed, which is a wild plant, was often put into Mulligan stews but it had to be young pigweed, the young plant. And I thought, somebody must have put old pigweed in it, it must have happened, and then somebody would be saying ‘Who put old pigweed in the Mulligan ’. So really that’s all it is.
