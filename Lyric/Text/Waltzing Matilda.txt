Waltzing Matilda is a song about an Australian hobo
|C                            |G
who wanders through the bushland carrying meager belongings
|C           ~G               |Am              ~F
wrapped up in a old blanket strung across his shoulders with a piece of twine,
|C                            |G7              ~C
and this is called his       SWAG. Hence the name SWAGMAN
|C                            |F
Affectionately, or otherwise, he refers to this SWAG as Matilda.
|C                            |F
Its like his only companion as he wanders through the bush track
|C            ~G              |Am             ~F
he finds himself talking to it.
