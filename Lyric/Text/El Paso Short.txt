#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|G          |           |D          |G
One night a wild young cowboy came in,
|D         |D7
Wild as the West Texas wind...
D7
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
|D7                                 |G
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.
|A7
So in an - ger
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
-
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.
-
#VERSE 3 --------------------------------
Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
-
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.
-
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
I saddled up and away I did go,
Riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.
And as last here
#VERSE 4 --------------------------------
I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rose's Cantina below.
-
My love is strong and it pushes me onward,
Down off the hill to Felina I go.
-
#ODD VERSE --------------------------------
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
-
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.
-
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
-
#VERSE 5 --------------------------------
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
-
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina goodbye.
