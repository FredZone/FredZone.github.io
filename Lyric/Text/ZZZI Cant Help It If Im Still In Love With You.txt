INTRO  I CANT HELP IT IF IM STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU
|G7      C          G7     C 
Today I passed you on the street
|C7     F                  C 
And my heart fell at your feet
|        G7                                C 
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
|G7       C          G7      C 
Somebody else stood by your side
|C7     F              C 
And he looked so satisfied
|        G7                                C   C7 
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You

|  F                                 C 
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
|     G7                                      C    C7 
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
|     F                            C 
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
|        G7                                C 
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You

(repeat #1)
|C7   F                                C 
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
|    G7                              C  C7 
And hold you just the way I used to do
|   F                            C 
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
|        G7                                C 
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
