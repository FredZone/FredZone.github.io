|C                          |F            ~C
Water in the well been poisoned with lies
|F                          |C
Weeping in the promised land
|C                          |F            ~C
Satan's dark angels are falling from the sky

Weeping in the promised land
|Am                         |C
Children of God, he turns into stone
|F                          |G
The sick and the weak, he dances on their bones

Fork-tongued pharaoh, behold he comes to seek

Weeping in the promised land
|C                          |F            ~C
Hissing and spewing, it's power that he seeks

Weeping in the promised land
|Am                         |C
With dread in their eyes, all the nurses are crying
|F                          |G
Everywhere sorrow, everywhere dying
|Am                         |C
Pharoah keeps preaching but he never had a plan

Weeping in the promised land

Weeping in the promised land

Shoot you in your bed just like they done before

Weeping in the promised land
|Am                         |C
Out in the street, on your neck with a knee
|F                          |G
All the people are crying your last words 'I can't breathe'
(Pause)
|NC                         |NC
|Am                         |C
And the white judge say 'there's been no crime here today'
