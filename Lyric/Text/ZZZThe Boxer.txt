Verse
|C                  |                            
I am just a poor boy, though my 
|C                  |Am
story  is   seldom  told.
|Am                 |G           
              I have squandered my 
|G7                 |G6  
resistance,          For a pocketful of
|G                  |          
 mumbles, such are promises. 
|C                  |
                   All lies and 
|Am                 |G
jest; Still, a man hears what he
 |F                 |F                
wants to hear and disregards the 
|C                  |G
rest.
|F                  |C
-
      |C                                              |Am
When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy,
      |G
In the company of strangers,
      |G7          |G6              |C
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared.
      |Am          |G             |F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters,
                       |C
Where the ragged people go.
       |G              |F   |C6  |Dm7  |C
Lookin' for the places, only they would know.

|Am    |Em  |Am |G |C
Lie-da-lie

      |C                                        |Am
Asking only workman's wages I come lookin' for a job,
            |G
But I get no offers,
      |G7              |G6               |C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.
      |Am              |G                  |F
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome,
                   |C
I took some comfort there.
|G      |G7     |G6     |C
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

       |C                                              |Am        |G
And I m laying out my winter clothes, and wishing I was gone, goin home
         |G7           |G6            |C         |Em       |Am     |G|G7|C
Where the New York City winters aren t bleedin  me, leadin  me goin home.

      |C                                            |Am
In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade,
      |G                              |G7
And he carries the reminders, of every glove that laid him down,
  |C                                             |Am
Or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame,
     |G            |F
"I am leaving, I am leaving."
                       |C  |G7 |G6 |C
But the fighter still remains

      |Am
Lie-la-lie
      |Em
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
      |Am
Lie la lie
|G
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie  10X

|G                                     |C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie
