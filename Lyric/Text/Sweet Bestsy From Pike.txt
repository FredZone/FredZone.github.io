Now don't you remember Sweet Betsy from Pike
                                   A7        D7
Who crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
G                C            G
Two yoke of oxen a big yeller dog
                            D7          G
A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

                             D7            G
One evenin' quite early they camped on the plat
                      A7          D7
Down by the road on a green shady flat
G                         C           G
Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose
                             D7          G
And Ike he just gazed on his Pike County Road

                                        D7         G
Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
                         A7      D7
Down in the sand she lay rollin' about
G                        C            G
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
                             D7           G
Said Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes

                                 D7         G
Well the Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
                             A7          D7
The last piece of bacon that mornin' was fried
G                       C         G
Ike got discouraged and Betsy got mad
                                   D7          G
The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad

                             D7             G
Well a miner said Betsy will you dance with me
                           A7            D7
I will now ol' hoss if you don't make to free
G                              C            G
But don't dance me hard do you want to know why
                                D7         G
Doggone you I'm chalked full of strong alkali

                        D7         G
Ike and Sweet Betsy got married of course
                        A7         D7
But Ike gettin' jealous obtained a divorce
G                    C           G
Betsy well satisfied said with a shout
                            D7              G
Good-bye you big lummox I'm glad you backed out
