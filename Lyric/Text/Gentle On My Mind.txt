|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |Dmaj7
It's knowing that your door is always open And your path is free to
|Em                 |%                  |%                  |%
walk
|Em                 |Emaj7              |Em7                |A
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag Rolled up and stashed behind your
|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |%
couch
|D                  |Dmaj7              |%                  |%
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
|D                  |Dmaj7              |Em                 |%
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
|Em                 |Emmaj7             |Em7                |A
That keeps you in the backroads By the rivers of my memory
|Em                 |A                  |D                  |%
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |Dmaj7
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy Planted on their columns now
|Em                 |%                  |%                  |%
that bind me
|Em                 |Emaj7              |Em7                |A
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together
|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |%
walking
|D                  |Dmaj7              |%                  |%
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing Or forgiving
|D                  |Dmaj7              |Em                 |%
when I walk along some railroad track and find
|Em                 |Emmaj7             |Em7                |A
That you're moving on the backroads By the rivers of my memory
|Em                 |A                  |D                  |%
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |Dmaj7
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines And the junkyards and the highways
|Em                 |%                  |%                  |%
 come between us
|Em                 |Emaj7              |Em7                |A
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother 'Cause she turned and I was
|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |%
gone
|D                  |Dmaj7              |%                  |%
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
|D                  |Dmaj7              |Em                 |%
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
|Em                 |Emmaj7             |Em7                |A
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
|Em                 |A                  |D                  |%
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

train yard
|Em                 |Emaj7              |Em7                |A
My beard a erupts in' coal pile, and A dirty hat pulled low
|D                  |Dmaj7              |D6                 |%
across my face
|D                  |Dmaj7              |%                  |%
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can I pretend to hold you to my breast

and find

That you're waiting from the backroads By the rivers of my memories
