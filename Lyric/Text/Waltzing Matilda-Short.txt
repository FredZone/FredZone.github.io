@@Waltzing Matilda is a song about an Australian hobo who wanders through the bushland carrying meager belongings wrapped up in a old blanket strung across his shoulders with a piece of twine, and this is called his SWAG.  Hence the name SWAGMAN  Affectionately, or otherwise, he refers to this SWAG as Matilda.  Its like his only companion as he wanders through the bush track he finds himself talking to it.  So Waltzing Matilda has nothing to do with dancing, it means carrying this thing on your back  through the outback  (pay attention because I will be asking questions afterward)
