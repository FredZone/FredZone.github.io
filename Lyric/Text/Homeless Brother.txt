#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|G                   |%                   |C                   |%                   
I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,
|E                   |%                   |Am                  |%                   
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,
|D                   |%                   |G                   |%                   
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.
#CHORUS 1 -------------------------------
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
|D                   |G                   |C                   |%                   
that homeless brother is my friend.
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|G                   |%                   |C                   |%                   
It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,
|E                   |%                   |Am                  |%                   
but living's so much harder where the heartless people go.
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,
|D                   |%                   |G                   |%                   
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of frill.
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.
#CHORUS 2 -------------------------------
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
|D                   |G                   |C                   |%                   
that homeless brother is my friend.
#VERSE 3 --------------------------------
|G                   |%                   |C                   |%                   
Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,
|E                   |%                   |Am                  |%                   
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
But somewhere's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're traveling jungle-style.
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men, Where 
|D                   |%                   |G                   |%                   
those who keep their senses have them taken back again, Where the 
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
Nightstick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't pretend,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.
#CHORUS 3 -------------------------------
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
|D                   |G                   |C                   |%                   
that homeless brother is my friend.
#VERSE 4 --------------------------------
|G                   |%                   |C                   |%                   
The ghosts of highway royalty have vanished in the night,
|E                   |%                   |Am                  |%                   
The Whitman wanderer walking toward a glowing inner light.
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
The children have grown older and the cops have gripped us tight,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
There's no spot round the melting pot for free men in their flight.
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
And you who leave on promises and prosper as you please,
|D                   |%                   |G                   |%                   
The victim of your riches often dies of your disease,  He can't 
|F                   |C                   |Am                  |F                   
Hear the factory whistle, just the lonesome freight train's wheeze,
|C                   |G                   |F                   |C                   
He's living on good fortune, he ain't dying on his knees.
#CHORUS 4 -------------------------------
|F                   |G                   |C                   |Am                  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
|D                   |G                   |C                   |%                   
that homeless brother is my friend.
