INTRO  DANNYS SONG
|A          |G              |Gbm
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
           |B7                          |E
And we've just begun, think I'm gonna have a son
 |A             |G            |Gbm
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove
    |B7                           |E
Conceived in love, sun is gonna shine above
#Break------------------------------------
CHORUS:
  |D                  |E
(And) even though we ain't got money

I'm so in love with you honey
  |D              |E              |A  |A/Ab|Gbm
Everything will bring a chain of love
 |D                  |E
And in the morning when I rise
  |A     |A/Ab      |Gbm
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes

And tell me everything is gonna be all right
#Break------------------------------------
  |A                |G            |Gbm
Seems as though a month ago I was down and tied
           |B                          |E
Never got high, oh I was a sorry guy
 |A              |G            |Gbm
Now a smile, a face, a girl that shares my name
    |B7                           |E
Now I'm through with the game, this boy will never be the same
#Break------------------------------------

Everything will bring a chain of love
 |D                |E
And in the morning when I rise
  |A     |A/Ab      |Gbm
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
     |B7            |E
And tell me everything is gonna be all right

  |A                |G            |Gbm
Pisces Virgo rising is a very good sign
           |B7                          |E
Strong and kind, and the little boy is mine
 |A               |G            |Gbm
Now I see a family where there once was none
    |B7                           |E
Now we've just begun, yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun
#Break------------------------------------

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup
          |B7                          |E
Drink it up, love her and she'll bring you luck
 |A               |G                        |Gbm
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home
    |B7                           |E
Don't you live alone, try to learn what lover's own
