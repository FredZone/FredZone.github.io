|Am                      |%
-                               hello darkness, my old

#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|G                       |G
Friend,                    I've come to talk with you
|Am                      |%
Again,                  because a vision softly
|F     ~C      ~     ~   |Am
Creeping,           left its seeds while I was
|F     ~C      ~     ~   |%               
Sleeping,                    and the
|F                       |%
Vision   that   was       planted in my
|C                       |Am
Brain              still remains
|G                       |%
Within       the     sound             of
|Am                      |%
Silence.                      in restless dreams I walked
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|G                       |G
Alone                     narrow streets of cobble
|Am                      |%
Stone,                    'neath the halo of a
|F     ~C      ~     ~   |Am
Street lamp,                  I turned my collar to the
|F     ~C      ~     ~   |%               
Cold and damp                  when my
|F                       |%
Eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon
|C                       |Am
Light that split the              night
|G                       |%
And touched the sound
|Am                      |%
Of silence.
#SE 3 --------------------------------
|Am                        |G
And in the naked light I saw
|Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
|Am               |F      |C
People talking without speaking,
|Am                   |F      |C
People hearing without listening,
|F                      |C
People writing songs that voices never share
|Am
And no one dare
|G       |Am
Disturb the sound of silence.
#SE 4 --------------------------------
|Am                        |G
Fools said i, you do not know
|Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
|Am                    |F         |C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
|Am                   |F          |C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
|F                         |C
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
|Am
And echoed
|G       |Am
In the wells of silence
#SE 5 --------------------------------
|Am                       |G
And the people bowed and prayed
|Am
To the neon god they made.
|Am                        |F     |C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
|Am                    |F    |C
In the words that it was forming.
|Am             |F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
|F                   |C
Are written on the subway walls
|Am
And tenement halls.
|G        |Am
And whispered in the sounds of silence.
