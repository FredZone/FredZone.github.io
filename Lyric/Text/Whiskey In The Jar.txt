@@The song's exact origins are unknown. A number of its lines and the general plot resemble those of a contemporary broadside ballad "Patrick Fleming"
@@Alan Lomax suggests that the song originated in the 17th century
@@At some point, the song came to the United States and was a favourite in Colonial America because of its irreverent attitude toward British officials.
@@The song appeared close to its modern version in a precursor called "The Sporting Hero, or, Whiskey in the Bar" in the mid-1850s
