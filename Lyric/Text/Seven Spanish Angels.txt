#VERSE 1 --------------------------------
|C                  |C
Down   into   her   brown eyes and said
|C                  |G
Say a   prayer   for me           she
|G                  |G
Threw her arms around him, whispered
|G                  |C
“god will keep us free.”    they could
|C                  |C
Hear   the   riders  comin’       he said,
|C                  |F
“this is my last    fight      if they
|F                  |C
Take me back to      Texas       they won't

|C                  |C
Seven     Spanish   angels      at the
|C                  |G
Altar  of  the      sun     they were
|G                  |G
Prayin'   for  the  lovers      in the
|G                  |C
Valley of   the    gun    when the
|C                  |C
Battle stopped and the smoke cleared there was
|C                  |F
Thunder from the throne
|F                  |C
And seven Spanish angels       took
|G                  |C
Another angel home        she reached
#VERSE 2 --------------------------------
|C                  |C
Down and picked the gun up   that lay
|C                  |G
Smokin’ in   his     hand    she said,
|G                  |G
"father please forgive me    I can't
|G                  |C
Make it without   my man     and she
|C                  |C
Knew the  gun  was  empty    and she
|C                  |F
Knew she couldn’t win        but her
|F                  |C
Final prayer was answered    when the
|G                  |C
Rifles fired again

Valley of   the    gun    when the
|C                  |C
