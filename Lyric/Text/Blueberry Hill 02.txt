              I found my
|F             |
thrill          On Blueberry
|C             |
Hill            On Blueberry
|G7            |
Hill            When I found
|C             |
 you           The moon stood
|F             |
still             On Blueberry
|C             |
Hill             It lingered
|G7            |
until            My dreams came
|C      ~F     |C     ~G7
true        The wind in the
|C             |G7
willow played  Love's sweet
|C             |B7
melody        But all of those
|B7
 vows you made    Were never
|G7            |E
to be

|F             |
Though we're apart
|C             |
You're part of me still
|G7            |
For you were my thrill
|C             |
On Blueberry Hill

|G             |C
The wind in the willow played
|G7            |C
Love's sweet melody
|B7       |Em       |B7
But all of those vows you made
|B7       |E        |G7
Were never to be

|F             |
Though we're apart
|C             |
You're part of me still
|G7            |
For you were my thrill
|C             |
On Blueberry Hill
