|E                                              B7 
Every time I look into the holy book I want to tremble
|       Gbm                          B                     E 
When I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple
|        E7                                                        A            Bbdim(7) 
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas than what I profess to be,
|       E                             B              A         E   A E 
And it causes me shame to know we're not the people we should be!

My mamma taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
|A   Bb     E                                                      A 
She said, "Therell come a time when there'll probably be room in heaven!"
|        A7                                                D                Ebdim(7) 
But Im feeling kinda guilty bout the number of times to do what we must do,
|          A                        E                 D           A    D  A 
But we forget what he said when we figured that Hed still make room!
