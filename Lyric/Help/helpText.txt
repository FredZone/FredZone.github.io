FORMATTING A TEXT FILE FOR USE BY THE 'PERFORMER'
	

========================================================================================
GENERAL
1) 	RULE NUMBER ONE!!!!!!!!!! DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!
2) 	The body should consist of 4 MAJOR kinds of lines:Data, Header, Chord, Lyric,
3) 	There are also 2 specialized lines: Spacer and Note used for special functions)
4) 	HINT: Use the the editor <img src="../../icons/blackEdit.png" style="width:4%" onclick="window.open('Editor.html')">
	to write this file it saves all kinds of time....and some tools are provided

--------------------------------------------------------------
DATA LINE   (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
1) 	The first line is reserved for the data and will NOT be displayed,
	so dont put chords or lyrics or notes you want to see displayed
2) 	If you want to pass data to the program in order to help it select a scroll speed
	and other display features your must arrange it as a data 'hash' make it scroll at the rigth speed
3) 	The first line is a data 'hash' consisting of a name and value separated by a colon
	and that pair is separated from the next pair by a comma
4) 	The recognized data you can pass is
	TITLE: (this should be the exact name of the file without the ".txt" extension 
	DUR: (duration in seconds)
	BPM:  (tempo in beats per minute
	BEATS  (beats per bar...3/4 = 3 and 12/8 =12 etc
	ARTIST:
	KEY:	(Key the song is in...)
	QUAL: (just a word or two to say how good it is  Crude, perfect, verified etc...)
5) 	The names must be EXACT and in CAPITAL Letters or they will be missed...
	None of the values are absolutely necessary but to utilize all the bells and whistles you need to provide data
6)	Example of data in the first line (extra spaces in there for clarity)
	TITLE:Silent Night,  DUR:185,  BPM:73,  BEATS:3,  ARTIST:Perry Como,  KEY:A,  QUAL:Good

--------------------------------------------------------------
HEADER LINES (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
These Separate the sections of the song and are in capital letters proceeded by a # symbol
The Program recognizes the following types and numbers some of them
	#INTRO
	#VERSE  (#VERSE 1, #VERSE 2...)
	#CHORUS (#CHORUS 1, #CHORUS 2#...)
	#BREAK  (#BREAK 1, #BREAK 2...)
	#OUTRO
	#BRIDGE
	#TURN AROUND
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
CHORD LINE:  (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
This Line should normally consist of following symbols
1) Capital letters designating chords (C,D,E,F,G,A,B)
2) Vertical bars to indicate start of a measure (|)
3) Tildes to indicate partial bars (~)
4) Flat and sharp symbols (#,b)
5) Forward slashes indicating a special bass note for the chord(/)
6) Percent sign indicating the chord does not change at the bar |% (all % signs must be proceeded by a bar)
7) Numbers as part of a chord description{used without an  space (i.e: A7, A9, A-, Am, Asus4)
8) An asterix indicates a short 1/2 length bar...
The example below covers 8 full bars
|C   ~C/B    |Am   ~Am/G   |F   ~G7     |C    *|%        |Dbm/G#     |Em9       |C ~F ~G  ~C
(FYI--in 4/4 time at 60bpm this bar would last around 38 seconds,{9 std (36 sec)and 1 short( 2 sec) bar}
The program uses this and other data to determine scroll rate) 

HINTS
1) If you want the chord line to be highlighted in color you must have a vertical bar " | " in the line
2) If you want the program to calculate the scroll rate  and duration you must use the "|" to show each measure
3) You can use small letters in the line and symbols not used in chords, for notes but use small letters and spaces to separate them from chords 

--------------------------------------------------------------
LYRIC LINE:(DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
These will be displayed as written but try to keep them under 80 characters of they are hard to see on a smaller screen
1) avoid punctuation if possible (use a small quote for an apostrophe or just leave it out)
2) DONT use a bar (|) or the line will be treated as a chord
3) Lining up the chords and lyrics is totally optional

--------------------------------------------------------------
SPACER LINES (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
1) These are simply used as space holders to balance the scroll or put extra lyric information if the lyric line is too long
2) They are usually placed right below a lyric line since they are formatted like a lyric line but dont get line numbers
3) The Program recognizes the $ as a spacer if it appears as the first character
   example:
   $     This would be a spacer line...

4) They effect the displayed length of the song and consequently speed the scroll rate

5) If a song has secton that scrolls by too fast you can put a spacer beneath some the problem lyric line it  will solve the problem by requiring extra time to scroll past it..

--------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE LINES (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
1)Designated with the @ (asterisks)These normally appear highlighted within the body of the song, and they are 
A)@  	These are intended to be peformance notes, like who sings ect...
		a)example:  @Joe sings harmony here...
		b)Struming Notes are also designated with a single @
			see <A onclick="postHelpFile('HelpStrumming.txt','Strumming Notation')"><X2>Strumming Help</X2></A>		
		@ Notes do effect the scroll rate so if you use more then a few distribute them equally
			throuhout the song to keep the scroll in sync with the back track
B)@@ 	Use a double asterisk for Trivia notes that are not part of the song but you wish to look at separately,
	They dont appear in the normal presentation...and are normally used at the end of a song
	They are available in a pop up note screen or in the edit screen, so they dont effect the scroll rate
	uses include: song history & trivia
C) @@@ 	Use a triple asterix for Technical notes that are not part of the song
	but you wish to look at separately, either in a note screen or in the edit screen, so they dont effect the scroll rate
	They dont appear in the normal presentation...and are normally used at the end of a song
	uses include: tableture,chord diagrams etc
   
--------------------------------------------------------------
LINK LINES (DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING!)
1) To insert a link just paste it in:  for example
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyKaH09lpc
2) If you want to 'name' the link put a "|" between the link and title
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyKaH09lpc|The Truth About PhD Creationists
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
TAB LINES (These are new!)
1) The I had an original TAB format to it I've added
	'TAB:@' to indicate a tab
	'71@'	to indicate the starting bar (i.e 71)
2)format
	"TAB:"
	"@"+starting Bar
	"@"+beats PER BAR
	"@"+divisions per beat
	"@"+spaces per division;
	TAB:@33@4@4@4>>>>>>
	each '@' after spaces breaks down as string:action  (i.e.) @3:5r meash string 3 fret 5 release...
	
NOTE the use must strip off the first 2 elements (i.e "TAB:@34@") to make the editor work	
--------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL STUFF
Try to keep the lines all the same number of bars since scrolling is a constant speed
Try to evenly spread the lyrics and notes so you dont have to adjust the scroll Speed
Long and short lines force the display to size to the longest line
DONT USE TABS FOR SPACING
