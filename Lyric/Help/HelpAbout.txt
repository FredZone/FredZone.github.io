Using Help
---------------------------------------------
This is as basic as it gets
Help is simply a list of links to html and text files
These files may be useful for anyone using the music files I have written
I tried to make the programs self explanitory and primarily write help files for my own use.
If something does not make sense, contact me.

Thanks
