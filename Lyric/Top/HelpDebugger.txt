DEBUGGER

I added this function to help me track errors

It records the last 640 outputs of the statusMsg()function
it can be reduced to 20 by a selector on the debut screen

The debugger records the statusMsg function: statusMsg(msg, color, marquee)

Convert the statusMsg("@@@@@@@@@@@@@@",X) X to 0 instead of  color) which records
the message for the debugger but does not display it on the Status Bar. So it is
invisible to the user...

Convert the statusMsg("@@@@@@@@@@@@@@",X) X to 1 and it executes a js alert with the message

Debugger records the initial boot process then shuts down...You can see
The boot record the first time you open the Debug Log on the Configuration Screen.
It is erased when you close the Debug log and the system is now
constantly recording the the last 20 status messages until you deactivate it

The Red 'BUG BUTTON' replaces the home button until you shut off the Debugger

In case of a 'crash' during the boot there is an animated bug on the 'Splash' screen
It may (or may not) let you see the crashed boot log,depending on how 'bad' the crash was.
