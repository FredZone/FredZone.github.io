My Experimental Music and BS Site
I have created a javascript program I use as an amatuer musician...
It works on my Windows PC, Android phones, Now I want to make it more professional
PURPOSE (GOAL): Provide a simple program for musicians to use that provides
1)A scrolling screen that provides lyrics and synchornized backtracks while a single musician performs
2)A common format and editor for the songs with a user friendly standard bars/chord/lyric notation
3)Must work using only javascript and a generic HTML server on you personal machine (Android Phone, PC etc)
