Total Bone Heads
 
A vast wasteland was the way
television was once described.
Where mindless folks on sofas
in shallow tales imbibed.

But then the internet came along
and promised a better way.
Where truth and honest value
would be the order of the day.

But, alas, the internet and truth
have proved an imperfect fit.
So sit back and let me show you
a load of cyber-shit.

Gaia uses ancient, alien texts
to find interdimentional beings
And they'll gladly introduce you,
for a 12 buck monthly fee!<!--<a href="https://youtu.be/Tn7bB58jiUM?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm">.</a><img src="PoemPics/Total Bone HeadsA.jpg" style="height:55vh" >-->

There's Gina Marie, the wack job,
Who dances to old rock and roll.
And filmed "Inter-dimensional portals"
While on a seaside stroll.<!--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm">.</a><img src="PoemPics/Total Bone HeadsB.jpg" style="height:55vh" >-->

Ray Comfort takes on Darwin
with something truly odd...
He shows selectively bred banana
and says it's proof there is a God.<!--<a href="https://youtu.be/BXLqDGL1FSg?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm&t=73">.</a><img src="PoemPics/Total Bone HeadsC.jpg" style="height:55vh">-->

But, I hesitate to point 
these videos out to you.
Since even cynical visits
just count as one more view!
