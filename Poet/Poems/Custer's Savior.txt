Custer's Savior
by 
Paul Zeigler



Custer's Seventh died so many years
ago.  These remnants, sent to save 
his ass sixty years too late, rust
in the Wyoming sun.  They'll last
much longer than horses, 
arrow-pierced men and the desperate
maneuvers. These vehicles face west,
catch the dying sun in the headlight buckets
long absent of glass.  It's too late,
I tell them,  Nothing you do now
can redeem the harsh reality 
of too few whites and too many Indians,
coupled with stupidity and ego.  Besides,
you face the wrong way.  The Little Bighorn
is miles to the north, and there aren't enough
of you to form a good defensive circle.
