Wyoming Limousines
by
Paul Zeigler

These two limousines gleam
in the afternoon sun. Here
in the nowhere of mid-Wyoming,
where even the road signs fade
into the background.  Two stretch
limos. "For Sale" signs grace
their windsheilds.  These cars
weren't here on our way north.
I would have noticed these long,
white lumps of affluence 
in the washed out town.  Now they sit.
Offer me a chance to drive
the back roads in style.  I want 
so desperately to dance a tango
with the women who brought
these cars to Bolsar, Wyoming
