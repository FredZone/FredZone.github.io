Total Bone Heads
A vast wasteland was the way
television was once described.
Where mindless folks on sofas
in shallow tales imbibed.

But then the internet came along
with the promise of better days
where truth and honest value
would be the order of the day.

But, alas, the internet and truth
have proved an imperfect fit.
So sit back and let me show you
some ghastly cyber-shit.

Gaia used ancient, alien texts
to find interdimentional beings
And they'll gladly introduce you,
for a 12 buck monthly fee!<!--<a href="https://youtu.be/Tn7bB58jiUM?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm">.</a>-->

There's Gina Marie, the wack job,
Who dances to old rock and roll.
And filmed "Inter-dimensional portals"
While on a seaside stroll.<!--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm">.</a>-->

Ray Comfort takes on Darwin
with something truly odd...
He shows man's "engineered" banana
and says it's proof there is a God.<!--<a href="https://youtu.be/BXLqDGL1FSg?list=PLgxx2UfYc5pHTU9LTtX7VFJvvzdAypImm&t=73">.</a>-->

But, I hesitate to point 
these videos out to you.
Since even cynical visits
just count as one more view!
