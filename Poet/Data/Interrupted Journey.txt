INTERRUPTED JOURNEY

By Paul S. Zeigler

Years too late, this train
is going nowhere.
Thin October sun lights
the hand real.  We left Omaha,
if Memory Serves me right.
It was night- the rain,
or mabe the sonw or merelyh
the turgid drift of moonlight
slowed our journey.
You smiled so often, trains
being a long denied passion.
I listened to the noise,
Coming to some, of wheels
over track joints.  Somehow
it ended here in Denver.
You left with that stranger.
I remained, listening
to B.B. King, Muddy Waters,
Bessie Smith.  Again, if memory
serves, the railroad failed,
a sepia postcard tacked
to my wall.  And this car
fortunately, was pulled
into a museum yard
where I visit daily.
